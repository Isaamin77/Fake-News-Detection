# Fake-News-Detection
This is a machine learning based fake news detection system that classifies news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing. It has a user interface which you can interact with and get your news articles classified.
I used a prelabelled dataset from kaggle containing fake and real news articles to train the model.
