# Fake-News-Detection
This is a machine learning based fake news detection system that classifies news articles as real or fake using Natural Language Processing. It has a user interface which you can interact with and get your news articles classified.
I used a prelabelled dataset from kaggle containing fake and real news articles to train the model.

Within this repository there is my old code which I originally was working on with Google Colab which did not end up giving me my desired results but I also uploaded the new and updated IDLE code which contains my whole project and working interface.
After downloading the files open your command prompt and navigate to the downloaded folder containing all of the files and then run the command:
streamlit run app.py

Incase you do not have the required packages please run this code first:
pip install streamlit
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install nltk
